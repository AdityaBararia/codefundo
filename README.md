 Prediction of Flood:

 The project is basically a mechanism to predict probablity of occurence of flood using  machine learning principles  implemented using a   GUI which would be expecting a concerned user to input data such as  air temperature, barometric pressure,  wind speed ,humidity,soil   absorption capacity and then it will be  predicting the amount of rainfall  which  will ultimately  predict the probability of occurence   of flood.

 How it works:

   1.Populating the data set on the basis of  previous climatic conditions related to rainfall.
   2.The algorithm will be trained using supervised learning on the data set containing  the following parameters(independent and         dependent varibales) such as  air temperature, barometric pressure,  wind speed ,humidity,soil absorption capacity and corresponding amount of rainfall as per the climatic conditions mentioned.
  3. On the basis of amount of rainfall predicted the probabilty of occurence of flood will be predicted and the GUI will suggest           precautionary measures to be taken by the concerned authorities and citizens of the concerned locality.

 Preventive and Managerial Measures:

  1.Level of alert will be issued on the basis of the seriousness of flood from ( low to high ) and the measures will be according to           the the seriousness level.
  2.In Case of catastrophic flood prediction the contact details of  concerned authorities  would be shared and Serious alert will be         issued.

 Feasibilty:

  As we will be working on pre poplualted data set so it can be used in remote areas where internet connection may not be consistent and     the data set can be updated also so it is quite feasible too.
